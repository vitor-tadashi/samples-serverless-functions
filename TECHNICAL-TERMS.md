| API                   | Application Programming Interface is the interface between the site and third-party programs and servers. On different online services or platforms, we can use the API to log in, instead of registering, through accounts in social networks.         |
| Design Patterns       | A general repeatable solution to a commonly occurring problem in software design. It is a description or template for how to solve a problem that can be used in many different situations.                                                             |
| Microservices         | A particular way of designing software apps as suites of independently deployable services. This architectural method is considered ideal when you have to enable support for a range of platforms and devices â€“ spanning web, mobile, IoT & wearables. |
| REST                  | Representational State Transfer is an architectural style of interaction of components of the distributed application in a network. REST is an agreed set of constraints.                                                                               |
| RESTful API           | An API that uses HTTP requests to GET, PUT, POST and DELETE data. A RESTful API breaks down a transaction to create a series of small modules. Each module addresses a particular underlying part of the transaction.                                   |
| RESTful web services  | REST Architecture based Web Services that are lightweight, highly scalable and maintainable and are very commonly used to create APIs for web-based applications.                                                                                       |
| Software Architecture | A structure or a set of structures of the system, which contains software elements, relations among them, as well as externally visible properties of those elements.                                                                                   |
| Swagger               | A software framework for an Open API that is a specification for machine-readable interface files for describing, producing, consuming, and visualizing RESTful Web Services.                                                                           |
